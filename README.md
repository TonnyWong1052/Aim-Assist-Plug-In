# Introduction
I'm writing an auto-aiming plug-in for all human gunfighting games. The plug-in uses advanced AI algorithms to track and predict enemy movements, allowing users to easily keep their targets in sight. It also increases accuracy, reduces aim time, and eliminates any potential errors that may come from manual aiming.

This plug-in is to be used as a reference only and should not be utilized in any production or competitive games.

I would output my config after completing this project

## How does it work?

```
Track and predict the enemy
 |
 v
Auto-move your mouse to the keypoint of the person
 |
 v
Auto "open the fire" (Mouse click)
```
